```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Start Redis (required)
docker run --name adorable-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis

## Usage Notes

- **Chrome/Edge recommended** for best speech recognition
- **Allow microphone access** when prompted
- **Speak clearly** for better transcription
- **Wait for Tal's response** before speaking again
- **Voice conversations are ephemeral** - no persistent memory between sessions

## Demo Flow

1. User: "Hi" 
2. Tal: "Hi! I'm Tal! What kind of website do you want to build?"
3. User: "A portfolio for my photography business"
4. Tal: "Great! What's your photography style and who are your ideal clients?"
5. User: "Wedding photography, couples getting married"
6. Tal: "Perfect! Ready to build a romantic wedding photography portfolio?"
7. User: "Yes!"
8. Tal generates detailed prompt and fills the input box
9. User clicks "Start Creating" and the website is built
